this is just a recommendation for markdown, please use whatever format you
like, as the crucial factor is any documentation is better than none at all

however, there are several advantages for using *markdown*
* supported by Github and Bitbucket
* supported in most of the languages you will write in
* you can write it immediately in your code editor
* there are serveral nice tools to convert markdown to any format you like
* its easier than reST(i know most of you love python) but i digress
